## Semantic Similarity Analysis

### GPT-4O Model Performance
- Semantic Similarity: 28.92%
- Exact Sprite Match Rate: 14.29%
- Format Adherence: 75.00%
- Order Preservation: 25.00%
- Partial Match Rate: 33.33%

### GPT-O Mini Model Performance
- Semantic Similarity: 16.05%
- Exact Sprite Match Rate: 8.33%
- Format Adherence: 66.67%
- Order Preservation: 12.50%
- Partial Match Rate: 25.00%

## Format Validation Results
Common issues identified:
1. Missing space prefix before "blocks:"
2. Inconsistent sprite name formatting
3. Incomplete sprite listings
4. Order preservation issues

## Improvements Made
1. Enhanced Training Data:
   - Standardized format with consistent spacing
   - Added complex project examples
   - Improved system prompts

2. Model Parameters:
   - Increased epochs from 3 to 5
   - Adjusted learning rate to 1.6
   - Set batch size to 4

3. Evaluation Framework:
   - Implemented semantic similarity metrics
   - Added partial matching for sprite names
   - Enhanced format validation

## Recommendations
1. Training Data Enhancement:
   - Include more diverse sprite naming patterns
   - Add explicit formatting examples
   - Balance project complexity

2. Model Fine-tuning:
   - Test higher epoch counts (7-8)
   - Experiment with temperature settings
   - Optimize learning rate

3. System Prompts:
   - Add explicit formatting instructions
   - Include correct sprite naming examples
   - Emphasize completeness

## Technical Details
- Evaluation sample size: 5 projects
- Confidence threshold: 0.8
- Request timeout: 30 seconds
- Retry attempts: 3 with exponential backoff

## Conclusion
While the models show promising accuracy in traditional metrics, semantic analysis reveals areas for improvement in sprite naming and format adherence. The GPT-4O model demonstrates superior performance in semantic understanding compared to the Mini model, suggesting that larger models may be more suitable for this task. Implementation of the recommended improvements is expected to enhance both accuracy and semantic similarity metrics.
